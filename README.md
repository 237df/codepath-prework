## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
features that make me like certain apps.
1) wells Fargo banking app : I use wells fargo and in their app, they have this slider in the credit section that tells a customer how much credit they have used and how much is left. untop of the slider is the percentage used and below the slider is how much credit they still have left. I am obsessed about my financial health, and just being able to get a full picture of where I stand at a glance makes my life a lot easier.
2)google maps (for catching the metro) : I don't ride the metro any more but it used to be my go to when I didnt have a car. I picked google maps over other navigation apps because it always had accurate times as to when the bus would arrive. Now, there were other apps specifically designed to track the metro, but just being able to see my whole journey and plan ahead made me choose a navigation app over the other apps designed for that feature, and having accurate time as to when the bus or train would arrive made me choose google maps over simiar apps for that purpose.
3) Apple maps (for driving around) : I use a lot of apple products and it is my personal opinion that apple products work best with apple applications. Apple maps just looks good, interact well with the other apps I use and has been very reliable while I drive around. Thus I have not had the need to get another app for that purpose when my device already comes with one. I tried it and it worked.
4) gmail (over the mail app that comes with apple products.) : Simply put, gmail is more organized and has a better UI than mail.

        If I were to build an app, or made updates to an existing app, my goal would be to make a change to gmail. One thing I hate the most is having unread emails in my primary folder. As a force of habit, I make it my mission to always check them. However, somtimes life gets too busy especially with work and school work that I may not get to all my unread emails on time. Few weeks down the road, I may eventually check all but one or two emails. The problem arises when I am trying to find that one email that I haven't read. This might seem like a very minute concern but it would mean the world to me if I could just filter all my unread emails without having to scroll through hundreds of emails. This is a feature I would want to add to the gmail app.
